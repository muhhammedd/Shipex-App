Project Status Update & Next Step Directive

Project: Admin Dashboard & Order Management System
Current Phase: Phase 0 – Layout, Mock Data, Dashboard & Orders Page

Status Summary:
1. The Admin Dashboard layout is finalized with:
   - Sidebar, Topbar, and Main Content area
   - Full RTL support
   - Color palette applied (#111111, #2F2F2F, #F6F6F6, #FFCB74)
2. Dashboard widgets are implemented with mock analytics:
   - Total Orders, Merchants, Active Drivers, Revenue
   - Orders Intelligence & Revenue Intelligence sections
3. Orders Page is refactored:
   - Reusable components: OrderRow, OrderFilters
   - Connected to comprehensive mockOrders dataset
   - Ready for CSR/SSR hybrid implementation
4. Order Details Page implemented:
   - Displays complete order info, recipient, financials, and history
   - Fully linked from Orders Page
   - Ready for future integration with backend API

Directive for Next Development Step:
Objective: Implement the next functional milestone in line with project roadmap, ensuring consistency, reusability, and readiness for API integration.

Tasks:
1. Extend Orders Page functionality:
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Connect filters (status, search, date) to dynamically filter mockOrders
   - Prepare the table to support SSR data fetching
2. Enhance Order Details Page:
   - Add visual timeline for order history
   - Implement interactive buttons for actions (Assign Courier, Update Status)
   - Prepare placeholders for future live API updates
3. Prepare project for backend integration:
   - Centralize mockOrders data in a single module
   - Ensure all pages consume data via a shared service or hook
   - Maintain separation between UI components and data layer
4. Maintain design consistency:
   - Use shared UI components (buttons, cards, inputs)
   - Keep color palette and RTL support consistent
   - Ensure responsiveness for all dashboard views

Instructions:
- All development must follow the current folder and component structure
- Components must remain reusable across different roles (Admin, Merchant, Courier)
- Document all new components and data structures for future reference
- Output code must be clean, modular, and ready for direct API replacement

Deliverable:
- Updated Orders Page & Order Details Page fully functional with mock data
- Ready for transition to live backend data fetching
- Clear separation between UI and data handling
